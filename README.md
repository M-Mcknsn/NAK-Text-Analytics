# Home Work NAK-Text-Analytics - Overview
Daily information and news related to companies are constantly published online, influencing various aspects such as stock market trends, corporate strategies, product developments, and political impacts. This project focuses on German financial portals like Onvista and Finanzen.net, which provide not only news but also stock prices, charts, and financial analyses. The main objective is to investigate the correlation between published news and stock price movements of individual companies using Text Analytics. Key steps include:

1. Data extraction from financial websites:     ```src/data_collection.ipynb```
2. Data cleaning to improve data quality for analysis:     ```src/data_cleaning.ipynb```
3. Topic Modeling to assign content themes and enhance the analysis:     ```src/topic_modeling.ipynb```
4. Sentiment determination within the extracted texts:     ```src/sentiment_analysis.ipynb```
5. Comparing sentiments with stock prices to identify possible correlations or relationships:     ```src/relationship_analysis.ipynb```
